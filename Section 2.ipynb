    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Statsitics is *hard*. There are a plethora of sources that discuss this, and also the tendency that we have to get basic things wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the references below to see what we're talking about! However, don't be discouraged. In this section, we want to develop a couple of things:\n",
    "1. An intuition for what *good* statistics and applications of statistics are\n",
    "2. A healthy skepticism of what you read and what you produce. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should be reasonably cautious about the methods used to produce some statistical results, and extremely skeptical of the interpretation of the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Coin Toss\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple first case: A coin toss. Coins are fun to deal with because they are easy to play with and to use. Let's imagine that we have a coin - C - with two sides, one heads, the other tails. How do we simulate a coin toss in python? We could just use a coin :) \n",
    "\n",
    "However, instead, we'll assume that we have a reasonable random number generator (we don't - more on this later) and then we'll want to simulate a toss as a choice between two random numbers:\n"
